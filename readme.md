#Grand Prix Testing

![f1](http://www.bettingsites.us/wp-content/uploads/Formula-1-1.jpg)

Formula One Racing has hired you to retroactively test some code they wrote. They request that you finish writing the tests in `race_spec.rb` according to what the `race.rb` already has implimented and what the existing `it` blocks are specifying.

>Note: `race.rb` has already been impliments, which is **bad practice** as you should always ideally write the tests *before* you write the code

When you have a unit test for each of the existing methods, write a new specification of your own either on `Race` or `Car`. When you have a new test, try to pass it!

Happy Testing!
