#Grand Prix Testing

### Part 1 

Formula One Racing has hired you to retroactively test some code they wrote to up their test coverage in perparation for a major refactor. 

They request that you finish writing the tests in `spec/` according to what the `lib/` code already has implimented and what the existing `it` blocks are specifying.

>Note: `race.rb` and `car.rb` have already been implimented, which is not **best practice**. Ideally, you should always write the tests *before* you write the code. However, at least we're adding tests now to preserve the code's behavior after the refactor.

### Part 2

When you have a unit test for each of the existing methods, come up with a method you think would be useful for either the `Race` or the `Car` class.   Write tests for your method.  

Trade method tests with a friend. Each of you should write code to pass the tests that the other person came up with. 

Happy Testing!
